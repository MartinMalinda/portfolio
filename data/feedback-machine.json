This meant that the forms were highly specific and it made it easier for customers to pass feedback about recent changes. Along with these forms a webhook was dynamically created as well, which allowed to correctly capture responses for each of these newly created forms.\n\n- **Forms table** gathered information about each new dynamically created form\n- **Responses table** gathered all form submissions\n- **Formulas & rollups** summarized certain metrics from the form per each form (week)\n- **Airtable interfaces** allowed browsing all of the collected feedback and displayed charts for the numeric metrics\n\nIn certain cases feedback form may be the same all the time. But in other situations itâ€™s much better to create forms dynamically - for organized events, courses, workshops it might be useful to generate specific questions based on people involved, topics and other criteria.\n\nThis likely leads to higher submissions too as the survey seems more personal and of higher quality.\n","Year end":2022,"Sync description":{"label":"Sync description","url":"https://airtable.com/tbl65sNEJFTfUKGhf/rec1RIDhb7nEagaBJ?blocks=bliClqOLMgmBUqdD1"},"Slug":"feedback-machine"}}
