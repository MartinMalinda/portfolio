This meant that the forms were highly specific and it made it easier for customers to pass feedback about recent changes. Along with these forms a webhook was dynamically created as well, which allowed to correctly capture responses for each of these newly created forms.\n\n- **Forms table** gathered information about each new dynamically created form\n- **Responses table** gathered all form submissions\n- **Formulas & rollups** summarized certain metrics from the form per each form (week)\n- **Airtable interfaces** allowed browsing all of the collected feedback and displayed charts for the numeric metrics\n\nIn certain cases feedback form may be the same all the time. But in other situations it’s much better to create forms dynamically - for organized events, courses, workshops it might be useful to generate specific questions based on people involved, topics and other criteria.\n\nThis likely leads to higher submissions too as the survey seems more personal and of higher quality.\n","Sync description":{"label":"Sync description","url":"https://airtable.com/tbl65sNEJFTfUKGhf/rec1RIDhb7nEagaBJ?blocks=bliClqOLMgmBUqdD1"},"Slug":"feedback-machine"}},{"id":"recBAZwAj9NKCMbZF","createdTime":"2024-09-02T14:30:50.000Z","fields":{"Name":"Student database","Select":"Automation","Image":[{"id":"attkVHqAu4rH3Wy7y","width":1080,"height":1080,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/32/32/1725789600000/HU43LqX_1kYmNE-1HaTeSg/_K_UuOIjNo1QWrp9kCDhJJ6VsorI9Hwy2fM-iY5DqngWIStf3UBK9EuPWYAd6RhwR0uG5Q9mojFYIPFK4gFLrg37Y516zoeC-n0xN29VGfY_8KWQhmjLDO0OqhZdLw3GjSQgChwyFnu7vTtMCemOarKOu9DoxM2uesgkY0EtqZM/0QK7pNlOc2N_p6jCmrBuCn6vkLMZOtaFibRF8-GaMVU","filename":"Untitled design (4).png","size":245138,"type":"image/png","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/32/32/1725789600000/aBIquCduQ2uR43c4l9V9cA/BkewbQmttX4OkJp3MSu-eWvgM0wb7GM0stRfm-4xfNLXhFmBMJywt8njpyS-Mh8EaJvd4PMw0uQMwhHNgItmqb--kVmjRc9uAgcZ0945vKdRE5_l-7Auw1eI_vMIjA4oTKTX5zvQ1TJKp67xDknhQA/r7Z2Le2CrDWmXifzeETZwGVfy9XfsN-8IAtR2yB8KIM","width":36,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/32/32/1725789600000/SXd4fnqK9vKzW7E0ilcmyQ/u2pSspLgOnMlOK583ba315h4roYvxTJmASaBxXL429KAVNN-ksN_q5s5IWVF8eixduZK2CCIzWLE_GN81oHOaj1bk5xiwRWaD-lwDZZnPGD21JhVumHDyC3sQoro1kwJhz0KVej9nlfOuD9ttfw4TQ/twUxkUh-LoOT4bCDHA5OWFWKI2jWxuEasrrXjesZDj8","width":512,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/32/32/1725789600000/bb4SOzdjc8MwSjm0z9K3vw/BFq5t_d35hDY4bRKEMhfAOrAhG8-xYYOuEW_uYyXTgisMW65QUpKXcVcX2ckmh7_cSaMJ4J4SW_YyWpVQPAeXj7tLf_jtdHax18eg8pqZ830ruZVXeiDzDwEHMP91Mjy0DR1ruY7l7Ym12tQygI74A/xC7w2Enp9c-B5r_zNBOuMaMZMVa-_aZGAoisD8C6EuA","width":1080,"height":1080}}}],"Notion URL":"https://www.notion.so/martins-automations/Student-database-85d3283652744fcb94ee4c94604aafdd","Description (from Notion)":"I have managed a large database of students, classes and mentors.

If successful, they were sent to Airtable. In Airtable there was an automated process to assign them to the right class and once a contract was signed, they were moved to Students table.\n\nA lot of complexity followed:\n\n- Attendance\n- Exam evalutation & result tracking\n- Project assignment\n- Payment tracking\n- Graduation process\n- Placement process\n\nBesides that I handled integration with different Invoicing software and exports from banks to create cashflow dashboards.\n\nThe Airtable workspace consisted of over 50 tables and many interfaces and automations. In the end it eliminated a ton of manual sync of data from different systems and manual repeated creation of many types of spreadsheets, all of which could potentially be fault to human error.\n\nAirtable provided structure for operations and project management and [Slack](https://slack.com/) messages informed key people when it was their turn to move the process forward.\n","Sync description":{"label":"Sync description","url":"https://airtable.com/tbl65sNEJFTfUKGhf/recBAZwAj9NKCMbZF?blocks=bliClqOLMgmBUqdD1"},"Slug":"student-database"}},{"id":"recGSyZQiSPDAANie","createdTime":"2024-09-07T08:31:39.000Z","fields":{"Name":"Release management","Select":"Automation","Image":[{"id":"attvqyWXJNfger6QD","width":1080,"height":1080,"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/32/32/1725789600000/Ykv-rC8rHaSmid8YjZ9BOw/pxl32hmT2OZ-uLrz3rgIK-O-f4YvgWgq2AGnq5Np9G-UxLDrwSC4_qPMCWCj0ZtwKdp8WXVQzjHS44sdKzZk4QOwe8z0BdiZHnbYCzyA9NLet7np9S3RBRBcbg1ctgT8AOXYopH9LfMh2ECT5Hu5DoHCQJy0WhkTq31-xKOHZq0-jCCFW44yq5xkt9_JsZWf/6Auq7taqYkjKKuuWaF8ibHY6UUmGvmDoXZ2NccmfLQI","filename":"Copy of Copy of Copy of Untitled Design.png","size":291619,"type":"image/png","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/32/32/1725789600000/LSSc7UQvtxjeFx1CoBn48A/oPLEq9qv0PsEUWelJSTwssfAbMLXzowXRUHpkbYjczyc2MqPMY8QMwN5k776z7ndov1fgT8qJ7j9Ph_V-zEt_LgnjxEGmwYtUoVpWIrCv8s5sPnM7q_cGOxe-hqiapcR9cygje_4KQ120SUouc008Q/vwtVoZ81an5GQFI2nHfqJfk3tHx_FS4S_r6XQ2nJBvE","width":36,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/32/32/1725789600000/kk3cEUD5tk_VJEN8R1Faew/Y1nSoW8l1MKXq0uEf2pwItFE9qDEmg8lZuX5IexpCnAVWPpPF9gUnvEnZFiGWb3S4tkG10TCz9NrRD2F71LTv7VE0Z6crtU2tHc2SozGANmPXxg0VlPd3ewVhxQJevHVicYBvfvEgDrNmLl70zsxBg/BOnayXPGPxVOJz178nAb0M63WUssJSZf8v-f-rZyC2Y","width":512,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/32/32/1725789600000/TsmBlODnZAMjEqCjfLl27Q/fdxsrDm0Jc3yyy9Iy8dBQRoc4_0jykciH1JSx_Q-9woaV75QiVkQrSPsE8sbTEY-Jdsd2FmXxIH8Fb3sbzB9q3Elw0QzlvlQmeRV7TaZJdwaDZfWRYz77_ZmxqBx3Emi4jLUUAt7VFMQcwlLoks2dA/FeRuO3ZDkkL6lEaDgGXUA22UIPLQNTCbJ4_mX2I3vig","width":1080,"height":1080}}}],"Notion URL":"https://www.notion.so/martins-automations/Release-management-72a6b769912c486f8e6bf0c37860b764","Description (from Notion)":"For my browser extension [Powersave](https://powersave.pro/) I built a base to track bugs, features and releases.

The form has pre-populated data from URL so it’s easy to quickly add feedback to any feature. An entire solution is built in Airtable.\n\nAn extra automation here periodically checks the latest version published in the Chrome Web Store and compares it to status in Airtable.
