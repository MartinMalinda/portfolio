This allowed custom automations based on invoice payment status as well as building custom dashboards via Airtable interfaces which showed up to date status of cashflow from multiple bank accounts at the same place.\n\nAirtable formula was able to convert all values to EUR and so revenue was easy to track month to month.\n\nHaving financial data in Airtable might be useful if you need to set up automations on top of your financial data:\n\n- **Custom invoice workflows**: payment reminders, notifications, issuing new invoices\n- **Connecting revenue to your existing data:** see revenue of each product, company or user right in the Airtable base\n- **Custom alerts:** identify drops or increases in revenue in specific areas\n","Year end":2023,"Sync description":{"label":"Sync description","url":"https://airtable.com/tbl65sNEJFTfUKGhf/reccVt9WzPEhZ3OzX?blocks=bliClqOLMgmBUqdD1"},"Slug":"cashflow-dashboard"}}
