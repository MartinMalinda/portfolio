This included processes like application handling, contract signature, class assignment, exam evaluation, class payments, attendance tracking, lecture & workshop planning, pricing configurations, hiring & placement.\n\nPotential students fist arrived in [ActiveCampaign CRM](https://www.activecampaign.com/p) where their application status was tracked. If successful, they were sent to Airtable. In Airtable there was an automated process to assign them to the right class and once a contract was signed, they were moved to Students table.\n\nA lot of complexity followed:\n\n- Attendance\n- Exam evalutation & result tracking\n- Project assignment\n- Payment tracking\n- Graduation process\n- Placement process\n\nBesides that I handled integration with different Invoicing software and exports from banks to create cashflow dashboards.\n\nThe Airtable workspace consisted of over 50 tables and many interfaces and automations. In the end it eliminated a ton of manual sync of data from different systems and manual repeated creation of many types of spreadsheets, all of which could potentially be fault to human error.\n\nAirtable provided structure for operations and project management and [Slack](https://slack.com/) messages informed key people when it was their turn to move the process forward.\n","Sync description":{"label":"Sync description","url":"https://airtable.com/tbl65sNEJFTfUKGhf/recBAZwAj9NKCMbZF?blocks=bliClqOLMgmBUqdD1"},"Slug":"student-database"}}
