Chrome extensions have to be explicitly versioned to be scheduled for release in the Chrome Web Store. Therefore features but also bug fixes are tied to specific releases.\n\nI decided to build this chrome extension in public. This means that the interfaces are available publicly:\n\n- [Bugs interface](https://airtable.com/apphqr05AVNkiqHIq/shrRrZlGJPV2OFcy3) to view and report bugs\n- [Features interface](https://airtable.com/apphqr05AVNkiqHIq/shrKPaOGtiHfmxpRi) to see the status of new features and to allow anyone to submit feedback\n- [Releases interface](https://airtable.com/apphqr05AVNkiqHIq/shr5fk1lpnNIRmbE7) to see the status of upcoming releases (roadmap)\n\nEach feature has a dynamic link to an Airtable form, which allows anyone to click “Submit feedback” and share their thoughts. The form has pre-populated data from URL so it’s easy to quickly add feedback to any feature. An entire solution is built in Airtable.\n\nAn extra automation here periodically checks the latest version published in the Chrome Web Store and compares it to status in Airtable. If the status is not published, it sets it to published and then it also changes the status of all related features and bugs.\n\nPeople who subscribed to certain features get notified the feature was released and there’s also an automated release summary posted to X.\n","Sync description":{"label":"Sync description","url":"https://airtable.com/tbl65sNEJFTfUKGhf/recGSyZQiSPDAANie?blocks=bliClqOLMgmBUqdD1"},"Slug":"release-management","CTA":{"state":"generated","value":"Ready to track your releases with Airtable, or build something else?","isStale":false}}}
