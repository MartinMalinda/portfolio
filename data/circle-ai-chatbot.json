Since we know which Circle user is messaging the bot, we can retrieve billing details and context from other integrated platforms such as Airtable.\n\nThe chatbot runs on a server connected to Circle in real time and uses the API to create and edit DMs. Circle is rolling out an enterprise plan with AI chatbots at $400/mo, but this custom solution is more flexible because we control the prompting and tools.\n\nOverall trend:\n\n- Keep business data well structured and high quality\n- Turn it into a vector DB (for example via OpenAI APIs)\n- Point the chatbot to the vector DB and let it become your knowledge base\n\nOff-the-shelf knowledge base + AI chat works well for semi-public docs, but this case needed a custom solution because the bot knows who is speaking and access is gated by paid community membership.\n","Select":"Automation","Sync description":{"label":"Sync description","url":""},"Slug":"circle-ai-chatbot","Tags":["Circle","OpenAI"],"Project size":"Medium","CTA":{"state":"generated","value":"Want an AI assistant embedded into your community DMs or a custom AI workflow?","isStale":true},"Year start":2025,"Images":[]}}
