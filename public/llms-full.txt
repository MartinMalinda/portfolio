# About

![Teaching](/teaching.png) I build operational infrastructure for growing businesses.\
\
Over the past decade, I've worked on production systems used by real customers, handled monetization flows, modernized legacy applications, and helped teams scale their technical foundations without losing coherence.\
\
I've contributed to and led architecture work at companies such as [Leadfeeder](https://www.leadfeeder.com), [GoOut](https://goout.net/), and [TopMonks](https://www.topmonks.com/index.html), and later co-founded [Herohero](https://about.herohero.co/en/), where I was responsible for frontend architecture and core platform infrastructure. Along the way, I also taught programming and led technical teams at [Green Fox Academy](https://www.instagram.com/greenfox_official/), combining hands-on engineering with mentorship and delivery ownership.\
\
Across these roles, the common thread was complexity: scaling applications, improving performance, integrating payments, structuring data, and maintaining code quality as systems evolved.\
\
**Today, my focus is on automation, internal tooling, and AI.**\
\
I work with small and medium businesses to:

- Structure data and processes so they remain manageable as the company grows
- Connect tools into coherent systems instead of fragmented automations
- Replace fragile manual work with reliable infrastructure
- Introduce AI in pragmatic, business-aligned ways

Alongside client work, I build products that embody the same philosophy:\
\
**Powersync** - infrastructure for reliable data synchronization and automation in Airtable-based systems.\
**Powersave** - a browser extension that turns everyday web activity into structured, database-ready input.\
\
Whether working with SMBs or stepping into technical leadership roles, my goal is consistent: design systems that stay stable, observable, and adaptable as complexity increases.\
\
Outside of work, I recharge in nature and draw inspiration from history and art.

# Cashflow dashboard

2023

To create a unified cashflow base I needed to integrate several systems: two invoicing SaaS and parsing of specific XML bank exports.

- **Invoices table** unified data from mulitiple different invoicing services
- **Transactions table** had unified data from multiple different banks in different currencies

Transactions were matched to invoices, tracking payment status and information from all invoices were summarized in Airtable interfaces. This allowed custom automations based on invoice payment status as well as building custom dashboards via Airtable interfaces which showed up to date status of cashflow from multiple bank accounts at the same place.

Airtable formula was able to convert all values to EUR and so revenue was easy to track month to month.

Having financial data in Airtable might be useful if you need to set up automations on top of your financial data:

- **Custom invoice workflows**: payment reminders, notifications, issuing new invoices
- **Connecting revenue to your existing data:** see revenue of each product, company or user right in the Airtable base
- **Custom alerts:** identify drops or increases in revenue in specific areas

# Circle DM AI chatbot

2025 - Now

Embedded an AI chatbot directly into Circle community DMs so members can access an assistant without extra authentication. Since we know which Circle user is messaging the bot, we can retrieve billing details and context from other integrated platforms such as Airtable.

The chatbot runs on a server connected to Circle in real time and uses the API to create and edit DMs. Circle is rolling out an enterprise plan with AI chatbots at \$400/mo, but this custom solution is more flexible because we control the prompting and tools.

Overall trend:

- Keep business data well structured and high quality
- Turn it into a vector DB (for example via OpenAI APIs)
- Point the chatbot to the vector DB and let it become your knowledge base

Off-the-shelf knowledge base + AI chat works well for semi-public docs, but this case needed a custom solution because the bot knows who is speaking and access is gated by paid community membership.

# Feedback machine

2022

Based on existing [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) data structure I used [TypeForm](https://www.typeform.com/) API to dynamically create new forms at the end of each week. This meant that the forms were highly specific and it made it easier for customers to pass feedback about recent changes. Along with these forms a webhook was dynamically created as well, which allowed to correctly capture responses for each of these newly created forms.

- **Forms table** gathered information about each new dynamically created form
- **Responses table** gathered all form submissions
- **Formulas & rollups** summarized certain metrics from the form per each form (week)
- **Airtable interfaces** allowed browsing all of the collected feedback and displayed charts for the numeric metrics

In certain cases feedback form may be the same all the time. But in other situations it’s much better to create forms dynamically - for organized events, courses, workshops it might be useful to generate specific questions based on people involved, topics and other criteria.

This likely leads to higher submissions too as the survey seems more personal and of higher quality.

2020 - 2022

I was working on a [new edition of UI](https://goout.net/en/prague/events/leznyvlkk/) built with Vue and [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/). Combining internationalization, SSR with specific SEO needs, effective caching both on the server and client, and optimizing the performance of various infinite scrolling content provided a lot of challenges. We aimed to make the new website fast, SEO friendly but also able to withstand massive hits of traffic.

I was the main frontend developer creating the user interface for the [Herohero](https://about.herohero.co/en/) platform. In this project, I had the privilege of using the latest technology of Vue 3 and Vite. I optimized for fast boot, snappy page and non-page transitions, and good scroll restoration in this modern web single page app. I created a custom media player with timestamp support, advanced upload manager and integrated the [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-cz) payment gateway.

Herohero had a rapid growth in Czech Republic and Slovakia and eventually became the [dominant platform](https://www.focus-age.cz/m-journal/aktuality/mikyr-a-ti-dalsi--poznejte-nejlepe-vydelavajici-tvurce-na-herohero__s288x17493.html) for content monetisation.

# Leadfeeder

2017 - 2018

After I onboarded in [Leadfeeder](https://www.leadfeeder.com/), I got a lot of freeway to improve the main UI built with Ember. During my time in Leadfeeder, we have moved a lot of functionality from the previous Rails solution under the [Ember](https://emberjs.com/) SPA solution and we scaled the Ember SPA up. This required some new refactoring, overall overhauls in frontend architecture. I implemented [Ember Engines](https://ember-engines.com/) - a frontend code-splitting solution.

# Release management

2024

For my browser extension [Powersave](https://powersave.pro/) I built a base to track bugs, features and releases. Chrome extensions have to be explicitly versioned to be scheduled for release in the Chrome Web Store. Therefore features but also bug fixes are tied to specific releases.

I decided to build this chrome extension in public. This means that the interfaces are available publicly:

- [Bugs interface](https://airtable.com/apphqr05AVNkiqHIq/shrRrZlGJPV2OFcy3) to view and report bugs
- [Features interface](https://airtable.com/apphqr05AVNkiqHIq/shrKPaOGtiHfmxpRi) to see the status of new features and to allow anyone to submit feedback
- [Releases interface](https://airtable.com/apphqr05AVNkiqHIq/shr5fk1lpnNIRmbE7) to see the status of upcoming releases (roadmap)

Each feature has a dynamic link to an Airtable form, which allows anyone to click “Submit feedback” and share their thoughts. The form has pre-populated data from URL so it’s easy to quickly add feedback to any feature. An entire solution is built in Airtable.

An extra automation here periodically checks the latest version published in the Chrome Web Store and compares it to status in Airtable. If the status is not published, it sets it to published and then it also changes the status of all related features and bugs.

People who subscribed to certain features get notified the feature was released and there’s also an automated release summary posted to X.

# Student database

2022 - 2023

I have managed a large database of students, classes and mentors. This included processes like application handling, contract signature, class assignment, exam evaluation, class payments, attendance tracking, lecture & workshop planning, pricing configurations, hiring & placement.

Potential students fist arrived in [ActiveCampaign CRM](https://www.activecampaign.com) where their application status was tracked. If successful, they were sent to Airtable. In Airtable there was an automated process to assign them to the right class and once a contract was signed, they were moved to Students table.

A lot of complexity followed:

- Attendance
- Exam evalutation & result tracking
- Project assignment
- Payment tracking
- Graduation process
- Placement process

Besides that I handled integration with different Invoicing software and exports from banks to create cashflow dashboards.

The Airtable workspace consisted of over 50 tables and many interfaces and automations. In the end it eliminated a ton of manual sync of data from different systems and manual repeated creation of many types of spreadsheets, all of which could potentially be fault to human error.

Airtable provided structure for operations and project management and [Slack](https://slack.com/) messages informed key people when it was their turn to move the process forward.

## Process audit

Operational clarity before automation.

### Process Management

Most workflows inside companies don’t start as systems. They emerge. A tool is added. A workaround appears. Someone takes ownership informally. Over time, complexity accumulates.

Process work starts by observing what already exists.

The goal of process design is simple: remove friction and bring clarity.

### Process Mapping

Process mapping is about making implicit logic explicit.

- What happens?
- When does it happen?
- Who is involved?
- What are the prerequisites?
- What are the possible outcomes?

Most organizations already have patterns. They’re just undocumented, inconsistently executed, or dependent on specific individuals.

Good process work identifies recurring structures, clarifies ownership, and solidifies what is already there. It should remain adaptable and evolve when reality changes.

### From Clarity to Automation

Clear processes enable automation.

Once the logic is explicit, we can distinguish between:

- Deterministic actions that are rule based and repeatable
- Contextual decisions that may be assisted by AI
- True human judgment and accountability

Deterministic work should not require human attention.

Traditional automation handles defined inputs, predictable routes, and clear outputs. AI extends automation into contextual territory, but only when the underlying process is structured.

Structure first. Automation second. AI last.
